## Building Images Exercises

### Build image-one
Build the Dockerfile under `image_one` using `buildah`
```shell
cd image_one
buildah bud --layers -t image-one .
```

Take note of the `--> id` statements that print off after each step.
Example:
```
STEP 10: RUN echo "file 5" > file_5.txt
--> f1c0bcb1d15
```
NOTE: All files in the `build context` are loaded.
      Performing a build in an area with a large number / or significantly large
      Files (that are not required) will result in unnecessarily slow builds.

Examine the images with `podman`
```
podman images
```
You should see the ubi image we based our build on and the `image-one` image
we just built.
```
podman images --all
podman inspect image-one
```
Adding `--all` should list un-tagged images as well.  Note that the IDs we saw
earlier printing from the image build can be found in the "IMAGE ID" column.
Also note the "Layers" from the inspect command output - you should see about
as many layers as you do "IMAGE IDs" if you started with a clean podman
environment.


### Build image-two
image-two will be based off of image-one, but we will perform some remediation
to remove the "BAD" files from the image. Take a look at `image_two/Dockerfile`
and see how we are removing the problematic material.

Now lets build and tag image-two
```
cd image_two
buildah bud -t image-two .
```
"Remove" image-one and confirm only image-two remains
```
podman image rm image-one
podman images
```

Run image-two and inspect the filesystem
```
podman run -it image-two ls -l
```
We can see the file has been removed

### Build image-three
image-three will demonstrate 2 points:

1. FROM may use image-ids OR repo/tags
2. the "BAD" files still exist

Modify the FROM in `image_three/Dockerfile` to use one of the last ids that
printed during the build of `image-one` (alternately you could grab an
"IMAGE ID" from `podman images --all` if this is a clean podman environment).

Build the image and check for the "BAD" file
```
cd image_three
buildah bud -t image-three .
podman run -it image-three ls -la
```

### Run an image-id
We don't need to build from a previous image-id to access the "BAD" file, we
may simply run one of the intermediate images directly.

Use the same image-id you put in the image-three dockerfile with the `podman run`
command:
```
podman run -it <image-id> ls -l
```

### Build a long running application
So far, our images don't actually run anything on their own. We have been
supplying a command to the image (usually `ls -l` or `bash`) for the purpose of
examining the file-system contents. For this application we will supply a
default `CMD` command to our image - and one that won't complete (which would
terminate the container).

```
cd date-watch
buildah bud -t date-watch .
podman run -it date-watch
<Ctrl + C>
podman run -d date-watch
podman ps
```

# Key Takeaways
- repository:tag and image-id are "Pointers" to layers / manifests.
  Part of the registry, and do not "travel" with the image.
- manifests are the interface to image layers
- how layers work together
- pedigree / metadata can be added to LABELS
